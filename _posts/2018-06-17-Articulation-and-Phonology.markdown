description: Articulation therapy focuses on the way speech sounds are produced. This includes pronunciation, but also correct placement of speech sound articulators (e.g., lips, tongue, etc.). Phonological disorders are characterized by error patterns, for example replacing all /k/ sounds with /t/, such as “tuti” for “cookie.”
